        <h3> Why is Intercountry Adoption so Expensive?</h3>
        <p> Intercountry adoption can cost anywhere between 30 thousand to 50 thousand, depending on which angency. This steep price is only really found in the States. Many of these agencies call themselves non-profits yet, most of the owners of these angencies easily make a six figure salary. So where is all of this money coming from? In theory, an intercountry adoption costs around 15000 dollars when considering the cost of plane flights, hotels, background checks, and the 750 dollar fee to fill out an application. So, if adoptions are costing about 30 thousand dollars, when they in theory cost about half of that, where does the extra money go? Straight to the CEOs who run the agnecy. </p>
               
        <h3> "Merchandise Culture" and 'Baby Mills'</h3>
        <p> The jacked up prices of intercountry adoptions encourage a 'merchandise' culture in the intercountry adoption community. It turns the children into products that these agencies are selling and advertising. Many adoptions agencies try not get children with medical complications adopted because they are often treated like bad merchandise. For example, I almost did not end up getting adopted because somebody put pesticide in my clothing which caused severe burns on 40% of my body. The agency called my parents and appologized for the gnarly scars and asked them if they wanted a new baby. In adition to encouraging merchandise culture, the unnesesarily high prices of intercountry adoption facillitates the exsitance of 'baby-mills'. Baby-mills are like puppy mills, but with kidnapped women and children. Some adoption agencies get babies from 'baby-mills' to make their rates cheaper, but still make as much or more than bigger angencies. </p>

        <h3> What Does This Mean for the Children Being Adopted?</h3>
        <p> The sad anwer is that they are not very affective at all. Lots of adoption agencies are international buisnesses whose profit is determined by how many adoptions they facillitate, so crucial details usually fall through the cracks. On example of this is the tragic case of Masha Allen. She was adopted from Russia by a pedophile. Her “father” posted hundreds of pornographic pictures depicting the physical and psychological tortures he was submitting her to. He did not feed her with sufficient nutrients and punished her for being ‘fat’ until she developed a severe case of anorexia nervosa. When she was put on the stand she said: “The abuse started the night I got [to the United States] He made me sleep in his bed from the very beginning. He molested me all the time. . . . He even pretended to marry me. . . . And he told me that if I ever told about what was happening to me, something bad would happen to me,”. She was six years old when she was adopted. Her adoptive father was put in prison when she was eleven years old. This tragedy could have been prevented if the agency did its due diligence. Allen’s adoptive father’s home studies were conducted, not over skype or a video call, but over a landline phone. When FBI forces raided the adoptive father’s house, it was a dump. The house would not have passed a normal home study, and he would have not been able to adopt Masha if the agency had done its job. </p>
